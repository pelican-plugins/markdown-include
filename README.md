This plugin allows the use of the [Markdown-Include extension][] in Pelican articles.

[Markdown-Include extension]: https://github.com/cmacmackin/markdown-include

Installation
------------

This plugin can be installed via:

    python -m pip install pelican-md-include

Usage
-----

The syntax for use within Pelican articles is `{!filename!}`. According to the documentation of the Markdown-Include extension, this statement will be replaced by the contents of `filename` and will work recursively. The replacement is done prior to any other Markdown processing, so any Markdown syntax that is wanted can be used within the included files.


Configuration
-------------

The following variables control the behavior of the plugin and can be set in the Pelican settings file:

- `MD_INCLUDE_BASE_PATH`: By default, the file name is given relative to the directory from where Pelican is run.  This can be changed with this variable.

- `MD_INCLUDE_ENCODING`: The encoding of the included files (defaults to `'utf-8'`).


Alternative to this plugin
--------------------------

Pelican allows the use of extra Markdown extensions by declaring them in the `MD_EXTENSIONS` configuration variable.  However, as [explained][] in the Pelican documentation, adding new extensions via MD_EXTENSIONS is awkward, because all the extensions loaded by default must also be listed.  Besides avoiding this problem, this plugin provides a "pelicanish" way of setting the configuration values of the Markdown-Include extension (`base_path` and `encoding`).  Furthermore, Markdown-Include extension must be installed in a place where Pelican can find it, what may be tricky.
